        <p id=two class=first>Mitigating Personal Information Exposure On The Web </p>

        <p>In this literature review, I will be exploring how to mitigate personal information exposure on the web by examining different outstanding issues with privacy and unintentional exposure, including social media and phishing techniques.</p>
        

        <h2 id=one class=title>Unintentional Exposure in Social Media</h2>

        <p> Unintentional exposure is common on the internet because personal information is often required for most sites. One way to reduce personal information exposure is to make yourself more familiar with the websites that you intend on using and the privacy settings within it. Although users with greater technical skill may change theirs frequently (Kwok Choon, Mary Jane. 2018, pg 431), privacy settings can be adjusted by any user. Social media asks for a large amount of personal information from each person, which can often be viewed by others if users are not aware of how to adjust privacy settings. Facebook, for example, asks for; names, address, email, phone numbers, where you work, where you grew up and other such information, just to build a profile for you. (Stevie Web, 2011, pg 14) States that “users with publicly available social profiles who provide truthful answers to these questions offer a rich source of information for attackers who can mine their profiles for information”. Web makes a valid point as these answers can be used to recover passwords or used in other ways to gain access to user’s accounts. For example, a commonly used recovery question for passwords is “What town did you grow up in?”. This information, if not properly protected, is freely available to those who can view your account.

        <p>Different social media also have the ability to link to one another, for better connectivity, but this can also be a problem because your information is now shared across different platforms with differing levels of security. This can cause issues, as the weakest privacy policies in the social network ecosystem determine how much personal information is disclosed online (Irani, D., Webb, S., Li, K., & Pu, C. 2011, pg 13). Another issue is that different information being stored by different social media platforms. For example, Instagram can display your location to other users with a picture you upload. Whereas Facebook has other personal details like current relationship status or religious views. A study done by (Irani, D., Webb, S., Li, K., & Pu, C. 2011, pg 14) found that “up to 34 percent of a user’s personal details are exposed on one social networking site, which increases up to 90 percent for those users with combined 6 or more of such sites”. This shows that when multiple social networking sites are linked, the quantity of data that users reveal/expose increases dramatically. 

        <p> A paper by (Beigi, G., & Liu, H. 2018) suggests that users are in fact the largest risk in exposing personal information onto social media. This is due to the lack of understanding that some users have regarding what information they are posting on the web, and not knowing how it is protected, or if it is protected at all. This correlates with both Stevie Web and Irani D, saying that the information that is publicly displayed is often unprotected, and is a rich source for hackers, no matter what platform it is shown on, and can be used for nefarious purposes.

        <p> Due to the rise in the use of social media and social networking sites, the need for controlling your personal information has increased as well. (Mary Maden, 2012, pg 11) states that “More than nine in ten (93%) profile owners say that they have a profile on Facebook, up from 73% in 2009”. This is a massive leap in social networking usage, and only further displays the need to protect oneself from exposure. In the same study (Mary Maden, 2012, pg 2) found that over half of social networking site users (58%) say that their main profile is set to private, which is another example of users protecting their information from other users. Although this is not a completely foolproof method to protecting your personal information, it does help to mitigate some exposure. This alone is not enough, as there are other ways of getting private details that are not displayed openly.


        <h2 id=one class=title>Phishing Techniques</h2>

        <p> Phishing techniques are different tactics that are used to convince people to give out their personal information. The definition of phishing is: “the fraudulent practice of sending emails purporting to be from reputable companies in order to induce individuals to reveal personal information”. Although the definition outlines emails, there are other techniques used when phishing. These include, but are not limited to: spam, vishing (voice phishing), malware, and link manipulation. According to (Matthew L. Jensen, Michael Dinger, Ryan t. Wright, and Jason Thatcher, 2017, pg 599) there are three main methods in protecting against phishing attacks: Automated removal, Warning mechanisms, and Behavioural training. Automated removal involves software scanning incoming content to search for any unwanted spam. Warning mechanisms are a different type of software that informs you if/when anything gets through the first layer. And Behavioural training helps users to know what the differences are between legitimate content and phishing attacks. Each of these individually can help guard against phishing attacks but are most effective when used together. These three methods are often used in large corporations but can be utilized by anyone.

        <p> Phishing is an effective way for people to get sensitive data from users, and unless proper precautions are taken, anyone is susceptible to it. A study has been conducted by (Mohebzada, J.G.; El Zarka, A.; Bhojani, A.H.; and Darwish, 2012, pg 249-254) on how a phishing attack in a university community would work, and the results showed that an attack on over 10,000 people in a university successfully captured credentials from roughly 9 percent of students and alumni and 5 percent of faculty and staff. All the participants in this study were warned about phishing attacks and how to avoid them, yet hundreds still relinquished information about themselves. This shows that everyone is susceptible to phishing unless you take the proper precautions to prevent it.  

        <p> In conclusion, privacy settings in social networking sites are very important and should be explored thoroughly by users, as this is a key part of protecting user information. Although there is no 100 percent method for protecting all your information online, there are several ways which, when used together, provide a higher amount of protection. And although phishing attacks happen to many people daily, taking the proper precautions, such as the ones outlined by Matthew L. Jensen, will also help protect you and your personal information.

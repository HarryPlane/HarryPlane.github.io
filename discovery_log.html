            <p>Week 1- For the Website awards task I struggled finding a poor website example, as we generally don’t use poor websites, if we notice problems with a site, we stop using it and forget about it fairly quickly.
                
            <p>I also struggled coming up with ideas for a new/improved website (utopia) because most of my ideas were based on sites I already use, and the reason I use them is because they are the best of their kind that I know of.

            Personal online security
            Social media security risks
            Cyber security

            <p>Better Writing
            Replacing Phrasal Verbs With Cues
            “When children are growing up...” may be more succinctly written “As children mature…”
            Rewrite the phrasal verb sentences below using more appropriate verbs from the this list:
            eliminate, establish, fluctuate, intervene, investigate, propose,raise, reduce, return
            Choosing Appropriate Adjectives/Expressions
            Some adjectives are more appropriate.
            In academic writing, appropriate sources are “very important”. Paramount would be a better word. 
            Choose Formal Words And Phrases
                
                
            <p>Contraction Alternatives
            Avoiding Personal and Subjective Writing
            Exercise Caution
            Accurate Formal Writing

            HTML- Starting webpage
                
            The following code creates a webpage with 3 lines of text. The first says “First Steps” in bold. The second line says “This is my Hello World Paragraph. Hurrah!”, the third line says “his is my second Hello World paragraph”.</p>
